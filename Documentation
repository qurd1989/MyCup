1.Models (Product, Category): Represent the core data structure of your
application. These are used across different layers for data manipulation
and storage.
2.DTOs (ProductResponseDto, FakeStoreProductResponseDto): Act as intermediaries
for data transfer between the layers, especially between the service and
controller layers. They help in shaping the data that is passed to and from
the client.
3.Services (FakeStoreProductService, ProductService): Contain the business
logic of your application. They interact with external APIs, process data,
and provide the necessary data to the controllers. The services often convert
models into DTOs for returning data to the client.
4.Controllers (ProductController): Handle incoming HTTP requests, interact
with services, and send out responses. They serve as the interface between
the client (e.g., a web application) and the backend.
5.Configuration (RestTemplateConfiguration): Provides necessary configurations
(like the RestTemplate bean) that other layers depend on for performing

operations, such as making HTTP requests.
